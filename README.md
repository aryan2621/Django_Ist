## Installation

First check the version of the django inside your system

```bash
python -m django --version

```
After getting the response inform of some digits like 3.5.1

```bash
django-admin startproject mysite
```
and then 

```bash
 django manage.py runserver
```
    
This will open your chrome browser with a web page django written on it.

For further breaking of your projects into apps

```bash
python manage.py startapp app1
```
